# TabComp Organization

We created a GitHub **Organization** for our team instead of a single repository.  
This allows us to:
- Create multiple repositories for code clarity and modularity
- Use GitHub Projects for unified project management and issue tracking
- Keep collaboration simple with all repos under one org

## Members
See [GROUP-INFO](./GROUP-INFO) for member names and skills.

## Deliverable 1
- Instructor and TA have been invited to the org.
- Screenshot of GROUP-INFO and org link will be included in the Canvas PDF.
